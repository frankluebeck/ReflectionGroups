ReflectionGroups: a GAP 4 package for reflection groups
=======================================================

This package will provide basic functionality to create and compute with
reflection groups, in particular Coxeter groups. The functionality will be
similar to parts of the CHEVIE package for GAP 3. 

Overview of the functionality:
    ... to be filled during development ...

The idea is that this package can be used by other packages that deal with,
e.g., reductive algebraic and finite groups, representation theory, Hecke
algebras, and so on.

Note that development is in an early stage. At this stage any functionality 
may change at any time. Of course, the goal is a stable and reliable package
on which others can build.
